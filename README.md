# Python-Challenge
Module 3 Challenge - by William Fetter

Objectives: to Use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll

Pybank:
        Requirements: To create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
            - The total number of months included in the dataset
            - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
            - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
            - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
            - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
            
        Outputs: The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
      
Pybank:
        Requirements: To create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
            - The total number of votes cast
            - A complete list of candidates who received votes
            - The percentage of votes each candidate won
            - The total number of votes each candidate won
            - The winner of the election based on popular vote
            
        Outputs: The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
